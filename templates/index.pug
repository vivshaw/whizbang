  h1.display-3 Whizbang: chrome up your API
  p
    | This is a landing page template for Node + Express APIs. The design priority
    | is to give the user a responsive landing page with a quick rundown of what the API is and how it works, a link to
    | the project GitHub, and a form to try it out. The dev workflow priority is to make
    | a quick minimal-config solution so you can drop it in, forget it, and focus on actually writing your sweet new Express API.
    | It's as easy as "git clone", "npm install" & editing one pug template, it has built-in automation with npm scripts,
    | and it's even Heroku-ready. Built with
